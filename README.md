# 📦 Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and Real-Time Security Monitoring System

## 🛡️ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a complete Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solution integrated with real-time security monitoring for applications using open-source dependencies. It identifies vulnerabilities, ensures license compliance, and enforces continuous security compliance across multiple applications.

## 🚀 Features
- **SCA Scanner**: Scans 100+ dependencies to detect vulnerabilities and license issues.
- **License Compliance Checker**: Ensures secure and legal use of open-source components.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
  - Cipher Suite Analysis
  - Container and Cloud Security Scanning
- **Dashboard Visualization**:
  - Dependency Tree Mapping
  - Vulnerability Details
  - License Status Tracking
- **Continuous Security**:
  - Reduces critical vulnerabilities
  - Enables proactive risk mitigation
  - Achieves continuous compliance for 5+ applications

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask (for API services)
- JavaScript (for Dashboard frontend)
- Docker & Kubernetes (for container scanning)
- Jenkins (for CI/CD security integration)
- Cloud Services (for deployment)

## 🎯 Outcomes
- Achieved secure open-source usage through comprehensive SCA assessments.
- Reduced critical vulnerabilities across multiple applications.
- Enabled continuous monitoring and preventive security measures via a real-time dashboard.
